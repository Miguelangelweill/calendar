# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
[x] WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
[x]WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
[x]WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
[x]WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
[x]WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
[x]WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* The URL of the deployed application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.

## My work
* This is an app that keeps track of the time of day and your activities to be accomplished on at a certain time.
* When the user writes on the input and clicks save an animation will happen letting the user know that this item was saved.
* Whenever you are finished completing the daily tasks you can delete them all at the bottom of your list
